# Buying a Computer

This is a short guide for choosing a computer. 
For more advice, look up advises and product-reviews on Youtube or Bilibili.

## Laptop

The pragmatic advise is to pick a laptop from a reputable company within your price range that was made no longer than one year ago.

My list of reputable companies include Lenovo, Xiaomi, Asus, Acer, Dell, and HP.

Specifically, I suggest against buying old, second-handed, or refurbished laptops, because a computer made today may be similar in price to another made three years ago, but in much better quality. 
This is due to the rapid development in computer manufacturing technologies that has never been slowed down since its inception.

I would also avoid chromebooks and laptops made by Microsoft, as they offer poor quality-to-price ratio.


## Desktop 

Choices for pre-assembled desktops made from a reputable company are few. 

If you are not an expert, it is never a good idea to purchase a computer of a less-known brand, because those manufacturers may exploit your ignorance and sell poor products with high prices.

So my advice is, either to just buy a laptop from a reputable company, or to seek advice from a trust-worthy source before buying a desktop.

There is also the option to buy each piece of the hardware separately and assembly the computer by your self. 
Again, do your research before hand.

## Apple Computers

Apple computers are of great quality, but are also much more expensive compared to other products of similar quality.

If you want to buy an Apple computer, check the alternatives in similar price range. 
You will likely find them equipped with more RAM and more powerful CPU and GPU. 

That being said, Apple computers can be a good choice if you don't care about money.

## Dedicated GPU?

This passage does not apply to Apple's computer.

There are two kinds of GPU on the market for non-Apple computers, intergrated and dedicated.
Most CPU are incorporated with a small GPU on the same die, these are called intergrated GPUs. 
Dedicated GPU is independent from CPU, likely more expensive, but much more powerful.

Some computers only have intergrated GPU, and the classical question is whether one need a dedicated GPU. 

The short answer is that any one performing tasks related to gaming, video editing, AI/ML, and simulation will need a dedicated GPU. 
Others likely do not.

That being said, a dedicated GPU is always helpful if you can include it in your budget.

## How much RAM do I need.

The more the better, and 12 GB is the minimum.
Any computers with less than 12 GB will likely be a bad choice.
