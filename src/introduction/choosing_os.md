# Choosing Operating System

I will convince you in this chapter to choose linux for coding, Windows for playing games, and MacOS for donating money to Apple.

Let us investigate the difference between these OS.

## Comparison: Normal User's Perspective

### Windows

Windows is a widely available and stable system developped by Microsoft. 
It is shipped with almost most software a user may need, including a desktop environment and customised C++ compiler and developer suite (Visual Studio Code). 
This makes it ready to use out of the box.
Windows is also compatible with almost any software, including most videos games.

Windows, contrary to common believe, is **not** free. 
It costs around 100 GBP. 
When purchasing a computer with Windows preinstalled, the price of Windows is included in the price of the computer.

The important **_drawback_** is that
Microsoft has the complete control of a Windows system instead of the users.

For example:

1. Windows may force a system update, or keeping popping up remainders. User can not turn off the reminders;
1. Many built in software can not be uninstalled, including Microsoft edge[^edge], copilot, etc. A software that can not be uninstalled is called a malware.

Microsoft uses its unchecked right for abuse. 
There are many controversies on this, but here are a few facts:
 
1. Microsoft's privacy statement explicitly states that it will collect your personal data and share them with third-parties organisations. It does not say what data is collected, but a previous statement says it will collect personal information including password and browsing histories.

1. Microsoft's many software explicitly exploits user data. For example, Microsoft Recall, launched in June 2024, is a software service that helps user find what they have done on the computer previously. 
Recall works by taking the snapshots of the computer periodically and process them with copilot. Any other programs that can take a computer's screenshot and share it through the internet without user's permission is called a spyware. [^Microsoft Recall]

In conclusion, Microsoft have total power over Windows, not the user.


### MacOS

MacOS is POSIX compliant Unix system developped by Apple. 
It can only be used on Apple computers.
Many consumer appraise MacOS for its stability, beautiful apperance, and convenient interaction with other Apple devices. 
However, the drawbacks are significant: 

1. MacOS can only be used by Apple computers;
1. MacOS has serious compatibility issues. Many software can not run on MacOS, including most of the games and many developer tools. Some softwares refuses to offer MacOS support, some software's support was deliberately undermined by Apple;
1. Developing and releasing a MacOS software requires specific permission from Apple, which would costs thousands of US dollars;
1. Purchasing applications through Apple's App Store costs more, as Apple takes 30% of any purchase.
1. Apple computers are generally much more expensive than others to buy and to repair.

Similar to Windows, Apple has the full control of MacOS, and users do not. 
Apple also seems to abuse its unchecked rights:

1. Apple voluntarily stopped the support for OpenGL and Vulkan to promote Metal, a graphical framework created by Apple. This makes many AAA games not functional on MacOS.
1. Apple has secretly underclocked older devices (making them slower) without notifying users. 
Many suspected Apple did it to encourage consumers to buy new Apple products. Apple refuted this statement but agreed to pay 113 million to settle it. [^Battery Gate]

### Linux

Linux is a free and open-source kernel developed by the community. 
Linux distribution is an operating system built on the linux kernel bundled with custom system and application softwares. 

There are many free and open-source linux distributions, the most famouse ones are Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch, Manjaro, etc.
Most of these distributions are built by different group of volunteers. 

There are very few computers sold with Linux preinstalled. To use Linux, one has to buy a non-Apple computer and install the desired distribution on his own.

As Linux distributions are free and open source, a user is able to modify his system, including the kernel and desktop environment, in any way he fancies. 
This makes linux systems very different from each other.

Some linux distributions, including Ubuntu and Manjaro, are preconfigured and can work out of box just like an Apple computer.

The most significant difference among these distributions are personal configurations. 
Arch distributes only the most essential softwares, not even including a user interface. It takes much effort to
