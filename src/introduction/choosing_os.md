# Choosing Operating System

Every user has the righhahas to install any operating system on his computer hardware. 

This section compares the pro and cons of three common operating system, MacOS, Windows, and Linux in a user's perspective.

## Windows

Windows is a working, widely available, and stable system developped by Microsoft. Its biggest advantage is that it is ready to use out of the box and it is compatible with almost any software.

Windows is **not** free. It costs 100 GBP. When purchasing a computer with Windows preinstalled, the price of Windows in included in the price of the computer.

Even a you have purchased it and installed onto your computer, you only have limited rights over it. 
For example:

1. Windows may force a system update, or keeping popping up remainders. User can not turn off the reminders;
1. Many built in software can not be uninstalled, including Microsoft edge, copilot, etc. A software that can not be uninstalled is called a malware.

Microsoft uses its unchecked right for abuse. There are many debates on this, here are a few examples:
 
1. Microsoft's privacy statement explicitly states that it will collect your personal data and share them with third-parties organisations. It does not say what data is collected, but a previous statement says it will collect personal information including password and browsing histories.

1. Microsoft's many software explicitly exploits user data. For example, Microsoft Recall, launched in June 2024, is a software service that helps user find what they have done on the computer previously. 
Recall works by taking the snapshots of the computer periodically and process them with copilot. Any other programs that can take a computer's screenshot and share it through the internet without user's permission is called a spyware. [^Microsoft Recall]

In conclusion, Microsoft have total power over Windows, not the user.

## MacOS

MacOS is Posix Compliant Unix system developped by Apple. It can only be used on Apple computers.
Many consumer appraise MacOS for its stability, beautiful apperance, and convenient interaction with other Apple devices. 
However, the drawback is significant: 

1. MacOS can only be used by Apple computers;
1. MacOS has serious compatibility issues. Many software can not run on MacOS, including most of the games and many developer tools. Some softwares refuses to offer MacOS support, some software's support was deliberately undermined by Apple;
1. Developing MacOS software requires specific permission from apple, which would costs thousands of US dollars;
1. Purchasing apps on apple system costs more, as Apple takes 30% of any purchased made through app store.

Similar to Windows, Apple has the full control of MacOS, and users do not. 
Apple is also seemed to abuse its unchecked rights:

1. Apple has secretly underclocked older devices (making them slower). Many suspected Apple did it to encourage consumers to buy new Apple products. Apple refuted this statement but agreed to pay 113 million to settle it. [^Battery Gate]

In the end, appart from its apperance, MacOS is not so different from windows, except it is created by Apple.
