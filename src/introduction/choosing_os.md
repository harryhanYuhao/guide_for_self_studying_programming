# Choosing Operating System

I will convince you in this chapter to choose linux for coding, Windows for playing games, and MacOS if you have extra money to spare.

<!-- ## Desktop Environment -->

<!-- When using a computer, you are likely to use the mouse to click on some applications, after which the application will be opened in a new window.  -->
<!-- You can drag the window with your mouse and close it by clicking the cross sign.  -->
<!-- The software that controls your mouse, the windows, and how they interact is called the *Desktop Environment*.  -->

<!-- Windows and MacOS bundles the kernel and an arbitrary choice of system software together. -->

<!-- Linux, however, is only a kernel.  -->
<!-- A linux distribution is an operating system that uses the linux kernel.  -->
<!-- There are many linux distribution, including Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch, etc.  -->
<!-- They all use the linux kernel (they may use different version of the kernel) but vastly different utility softwares. -->

## Comparison

### Windows

Windows is a widely available and stable system developped by Microsoft. 
It is ready to use out of the box and is compatible with almost any software, including most videos games.

Windows, contrary to common believe, is **not** free. 
It costs around 100 GBP. 
When purchasing a computer with Windows preinstalled, the price of Windows is included in the price of the computer.

Here is its **_drawback_**:
Microsoft has the complete control of a Windows system instead of the users.

For example:

1. Windows may force a system update, or keeping popping up remainders. User can not turn off the reminders;
1. Many built in software can not be uninstalled, including Microsoft edge[^edge], copilot, etc. A software that can not be uninstalled is called a malware.

Microsoft uses its unchecked right for abuse. 
There are many controversies on this, but here are a few facts:
 
1. Microsoft's privacy statement explicitly states that it will collect your personal data and share them with third-parties organisations. It does not say what data is collected, but a previous statement says it will collect personal information including password and browsing histories.
[^Sharing Data]
1. Microsoft's many software explicitly exploits user data. For example, Microsoft Recall, launched in June 2024, is a software service that helps user find what they have done on the computer previously. 
Recall works by taking the snapshots of the computer periodically and process them with copilot. Any other programs that can take a computer's screenshot and share it through the internet without user's permission is called a spyware. [^Microsoft Recall]

In conclusion, Microsoft have total power over Windows, not the user.

#### Coding Experience on Windows


### MacOS

MacOS is POSIX compliant Unix system developped by Apple. It can only be used on Apple computers.
Many consumer appraise MacOS for its stability, beautiful apperance, and convenient interaction with other Apple devices. 
However, the drawback is significant: 

1. MacOS can only be used by Apple computers;
1. MacOS has serious compatibility issues. Many software can not run on MacOS, including most of the games and many developer tools. Some softwares refuses to offer MacOS support, some software's support was deliberately undermined by Apple;
1. Developing and releasing a MacOS software requires specific permission from Apple, which would costs thousands of US dollars;
1. Purchasing applications through Apple's App Store costs more, as Apple takes 30% of any purchase.

Similar to Windows, Apple has the full control of MacOS, and users do not. 
Apple also seems to abuse its unchecked rights:

1. Apple voluntarily stopped the support for OpenGL and Vulkan to promote Metal, a graphical framework created by Apple. This makes many AAA games not functional on MacOS.
1. Apple has secretly underclocked older devices (making them slower) without notifying users. 
Many suspected Apple did it to encourage consumers to buy new Apple products. Apple refuted this statement but agreed to pay 113 million to settle it. [^Battery Gate]

In the end, appart from its apperance, MacOS is not so different from windows, except it is created by Apple.
