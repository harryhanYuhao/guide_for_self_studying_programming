## Step 0: Setting Up a Computer

To learn computer science you first need to choose a computer and an operating system. 

If you have a functioning computer, that will be enough. 
If you want some advice on buying a new computer hardware, see [appendix](./appendix/advice_on_buying_a_computer.md).

Regardless what type of computer you have, I encourage you to try the Linux operating system. See [Choosing OS](../introduction/choosing_os.md).

Regardless of your preference, to make a wise decision, you need to know the basics concepts of how different parts of a computer works. 
[what is a computer](./what_is_a_computer.md) will help you with it.
