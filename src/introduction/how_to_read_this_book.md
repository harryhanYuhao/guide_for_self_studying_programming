# Introduction: How to use this book

## Step 0: Setting Up a Computer

To learn computer science you need a computer.
Any functional computer will be enough to get started.
For practical advices on buying a computer, see [appendix](../appendix/advice_on_buying_a_computer.md).

It is, nevertheless, always helpful to learn how each piece of the electronics and softwares work together to produce the powerful machine that we call a computer today.
See [what is a computer](../what_is_computer/summary.md).

You also need to choose an operating system. 
I recommand Linux.
Check [choosing OS](../what_is_computer/choosing_os.md)

## Step 1: Learn the Basics

One shall first learn to use the computer, acquire a programming language, and write some codes as an exercise.

Check how to using the computer on command line [here](../let_there_be_linux/linux_on_command_line.md).
Learn a programming language by instructions [here](../lets_write_code/chapter_summary.md).
