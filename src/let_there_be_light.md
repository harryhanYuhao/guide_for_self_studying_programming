# In The Beginning: Let There Be Linux

To learn coding one must have a computer that fits his need. This means one shall choose wisely the hardware and the software.
For all practical purpose any functioning hardware is sufficient for a beginner, but there seems to be greater misconceptions on how to choose the _software_.

The first misconception is that software and hardware are inseparable, as summarised in the phrase: "I want to buy a Windows Computer". 
What the speaker means is he wants to buy a computer that runs the Windows Operating System, but in fact, the computer can run any operating system he likes; let it be linux, BSD, or even MacOS[^OS_Nomenclature].
This misconception is rooted from the modern commercial practise to bundle and sell the hardware and software together. 
Many firms, such Apple with its Macbook, Google its Chromebook, and Microsoft its Surface Book, adopt this method as mean to advertise their brand name and maximise their profit, while neglecting to properly educate the customers.

The second misconception is that operating system determines its user interface and appearence, as summrised in the phrase: "I like MacOS because its UI is pretty". Operating system, by definition, is utterly unrelated to the UI or apperence. To put simply,
> _**operating system**_ acts as an intermediary between the user of the computer and the computer hardware. [^OS Concept]

[^OS_Nomenclature]: OS is short for operating system. Thus there is MacOS, ChromeOS, HarmonyOS, etc.
