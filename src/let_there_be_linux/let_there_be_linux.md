# In The Beginning: Let There Be Linux

To learn coding one must have a computer that fits his need. This means one shall choose wisely the hardware and the software.
Hardware is the keyboard, the chips, and anything one can interact with physically. Software is everything else, including the operating system, the integrated development environment (IDE), etc.

For a beginner, any functional hardware would suffice. As for software, I hope this article would convince you to try Linux operating system.

## Choosing Software 

It seems worthy to first clear up some misconception on computer software, especially the operating system.

### Operating System is Independent from Computer Hardware:

Many think software and hardware are inseparable, as summarised in the phrase: "I want to buy a Windows Computer". 
This is a misconception.
What the speaker means is he wants to buy a computer that runs the Windows Operating System, but in fact, the computer can run any operating system he likes; let it be linux, BSD, or even MacOS[^OS_Nomenclature].
This misconception is rooted from the modern commercial practise to sell the computer hardware with pre-installed operating system. Apple is more egregious as to allow a computer to run MacOS if and only if it is made by Apple. [^Windows_On_Mac]

### Operating System is Different from User Interface

The second misconception is that operating system determines its user interface and appearence, as summrised in the phrase: "I like MacOS because its UI is pretty". The correct definition for operating system is, to put simply

> \[Operating system is\] an intermediary between the user of the computer and the computer hardware. [^OS Concept]

Operating system is magical software that allow one to interact with silicon chips by typing the keyboard and watching the screen. 
Thus, by definition, operating system is utterly unrelated to the UI or apperence. In linux 

[^OS_Nomenclature]: OS is short for operating system. Thus there is MacOS, ChromeOS, HarmonyOS, etc.

[^Windows_On_Mac]: Macbook made before 2020 running on intel cpu had the option to dual boot windows. 
It is practically impossible to run any system except MacOS for laptops made after 2020 with a M series chip, because Apple is deliberately untransparent on the design of M series chips to hinder developers of other operating system to adapt to Apple products. [Asahi Linux](https://asahilinux.org) seems to be the only barely working exception.
