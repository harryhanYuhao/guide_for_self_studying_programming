# Let There be Linux

> And God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light. -- Genesis 1:3

This chapter will teach you how to install and use Linux. (Linux can not be installed on most Apple's computer, however.)

This is chapter outline:

1. choose and install a Linux distribution;
1. customise the Linux system;
1. navigate the system with the command line;
1. set up developing environment. 

Let us start by choosing and installing a Linux distribution.

## Which Distribution to Use?

For beginners, I recommend [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/products/download/x86) and [Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com/), both of which are stable and will work out of the box.

For the more advanturous I recommend Arch, which requires extensive configurations. 

To install the Linux distribution, you need to download the official image.

Manjaro (and many other Linux distribution) have different versions of images with different desktop environment.
(as explained [before](../what_is_computer/software.md#desktop-environment), the operating system is different from the desktop environment.) 
I recommend KDE Plasma and Gnome desktop environment for beginners. 
After installation, you can always install more desktop environment onto your system.

It is best to watch these videos[^videos for de] and check their official website to know more about the different desktop environments.

## Installing Linux

There are four steps to install a Linux distribution. (Besides obtaining the installation image)

1. Etch the installation image into a usb; (This is the most convenient way, to boot an image. An image can also be booted with a CD, netword, etc,)
1. Shutdown the computer, enter the BIOS, and set the proper boot order;
1. Restart the computer, boot into the installation image, and install the operating system;
1. Reboot the computer. The installation is complete.

In summary, you have to make a usb a bootable device containting the installation image of a Linux distribution, boot into this distribution, and use its installation software.

Besides the written explanation here, check this video. (To Do: make a video about it).

### Preparing the usb  

After downloading the installation image, you have to etch it into a usb, and make the usb a bootable device. 

The easiest way is to use [balena etcher](https://etcher.balena.io/).
