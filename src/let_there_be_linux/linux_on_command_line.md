# Linux on Comment Line

You can navigate a gnome or KED Linux system with only GUI(Graphical User Interface), explore and configure all of its features by only clicking the buttons. 

However, knowing the Command Line Interface (CLI) is always helpful, and, contrary to common believe, easy to use.

Here are the advantages of CLI:

1. Some softwares may only have CLI. For example, a remote server.
1. Many utilities tools were developped with CLI on mind, and may be more convenient to use than their GUI counter. Examples are `make`, `gcc`, `git`, `find`, `grep`, etc.
