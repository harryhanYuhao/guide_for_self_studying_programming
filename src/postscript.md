# Postscript

> Postscript comes from the Latin phrase post scriptum, meaning those written in the end.

I designed this book to serve as a guide instead of the definitive source of learning.
This means it will not contain every detail one needs to know; instead, it surveys the areas the author deemed important for a beginner and provides author's comments with information for furthur study. 
In particular, this book emphasises equally on the theories and development of computer science as well as the pragmatic tips for writing the code. 

Such a design is deliberate, as the difficulties of learning to code today seems to be not the lack of the information, but the lack of organisation and credibility of them.

The author strives to make this book informative, succinct, easy-to-read, and attractive, and wishes it be helpful for the fellow comrades in their early journey of computer science. 

The author acknowledges that he is constrained and prejudiced by his experience. 
Instead of writing passages with only undeniable facts, and in such way making this book a liveless encylopedia, the author believes, it is worthy to envigorate this book by presenting his opinions, where appropriate, in the price of potentially conflicting with those of his audiences.

As of July 2024, the book is still in early draft. The content is prereleased on 
[book.yetin.net](http://book.yetin.net) and 
[Github](https://github.com/harryhanYuhao/guide_for_self_studying_programming).

This book is written in markdown and built with [mdBook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook). It is deployed on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) with domain name registered on [Squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com/).
