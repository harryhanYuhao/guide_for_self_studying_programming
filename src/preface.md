# Preface

This book is a guide for self studying computer science. The targeted audience are those with little or no experience of coding, and those who learn coding only for a specific task but lack systematic knowledge. The only prerequisites are a personal computer and the the determinatin to learn.

This book does not serve as the definitive source of learning, but, as a guide. This means it will not contain every detail one needs to know; instead, it surveys the areas the author deemed important for a beginner and provides author's comments with information for furthur study. In particular, this book emphasises equally on the theories of computer science as well as the pragmatic tips for writing the code. 

Such a design is deliberate, as the difficulties of learning to code today seems to not be the lack of information, but the lack of organisation and credibility of them.

The author strives to make this book informative, succinct, easy-to-read, and attractive, and wishes it be helpful for the fellow comrades in their early journey of computer science. 

The author acknowledges that he is constrained and prejudiced by his experience. Instead of writing passages with only undeniable facts, and in such way making this book a liveless encylopeida, the author believes, it is worthy to envigorate this book by presenting his opinions, where appropriate, in the price of potentially conflicting with those of his audiences.
