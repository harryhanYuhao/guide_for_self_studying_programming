# Preface

This book is a guide for self studying computer science. The targeted audience are those with little or no experience of coding. The only prerequisites are a personal computer and the willingness to learn.

This book does not serve as the definitive source of learning, but, as a guide. This means it will not contain every detail one needs to know; instead, it surveys the areas the author deemed important for a beginner and provides information for furthur study.

The author strives to make this book informative, succinct, objective, easy-to-read, and attractive, and wishes it be helpful for the fellow comrades in their early journey of computer science.
