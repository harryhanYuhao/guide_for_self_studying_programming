# The Roadmap

A proper path to learn coding for a beginner 'only' takes these five heuristic steps: 

1. Step up a computer and its development environment;
1. Learn how to use the computer and, to a basic level, how computer works;
1. Lear a handful of programming languages and tools;
1. Learn the theories coding, including algorithms, operating systems, etc,
1. Put all of the knowledge into practice by writing a large project.

Upon completion you can claim youself a programmer. 
The ocean of knowledge of computer science, however, is wide and deep, and at this point you can explore it by yourself.


## Step 0: Setting Up a Computer

To learn coding you need a computer.

Any For practical advices on buying a computer, see [appendix](../appendix/advice_on_buying_a_computer.md).

A functional computer also needs an operating system.
I recommend Linux, which is designed by and for the programmers and can greatly boost your productivity.

Check [what are softwares](../what_is_computer/software.md) and
[choosing OS](../what_is_computer/choosing_os.md).

To make an informed choice on choosing the hardwares and softwares, you need to learn the basics of how each piece of the hardwares and software work together to produce the powerful machine that we call a computer today.
See [what is a computer](../what_is_computer/summary.md).

## Step 1: Learn the Basics

Many Linux systems run on command line interface, which is different from the graphics and click interface used by Windows and MacOS, but arguably more effective.
Check how to using the computer on command line [here](../let_there_be_linux/linux_on_command_line.md), and how to set up development environment on it.

### Step 2: Acquire Several Programming Languages

<!-- TODO: -->

Learn a programming language by instructions [here](../lets_write_code/chapter_summary.md).

### Step 3: 


## The naive Method

The _naive_ definition for coding is to write codes in a programming language that can run on a computer.
To achieve this is easy: pop up python interactive mode, jupyter notebook, or any online code editor for python, and type 

```python
print("hello world!")
```

You can then find some tutorials for python grammar and mock projects. 
After writing several hundred lines of code, finishing ten tutorials, and uploading them to Github, you proudly add python into your CV after only one week of work.

This method, however, will *__not__* get you far.

To write a truly amazing software, such as an operating system or a programming language, requires deep understanding on multi-disciplinary fields.
To name a few, one need to master the programming tools including the programming language, design an effective software structure, understand various programming protocols and standards, know how the low level hardware works, and study many applied and even pure mathematics like algorithmic analysis, logics, and category theory.

Studying these subjects is a laborious process, and very few may claim to master all of them. 
In many circumstances, one who know only a few parts can be called an expert.[^disclaimer]

You shall be, nevertheless, encouraged to take this journey, and your inner ambitions shall be alighted, because, by following this tutorial to the end, you can proudly and righteously call yourself a master of computer programming.
