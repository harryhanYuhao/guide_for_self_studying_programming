# The Roadmap

This book is a tutorial to teach you coding.
The _naive_ definition for coding is to write codes in a programming language that can run on a computer.
To achieve this is easy: pop up python interactive mode, jupyter notebook, or any online code editor for python, and type 

```python
print("hello world!")
```

You can then find some tutorials for python grammar and mock projects. 
After writing several hundred lines of code, finishing ten tutorials, and uploading them to Github, you proudly add python into your CV after only one week of work.

This method, however, will *__not__* get you far.

To write a truly amazing software, such as an operating system or a programming language, requires deep understanding on multi-disciplinary fields.
To name a few, one need to master the programming tools including the programming language, design an effective software structure, understand various programming protocols and standards, know how the low level hardware works, and study many applied and even pure mathematics like algorithmic analysis, logics, and category theory.

Studying these subjects is a laborious process, and very few may claim to master all of them. 
In many circumstances, one who know only a few parts can be called an expert.[^disclaimer]

You shall be, nevertheless, encouraged to take this journey, and your inner ambitions shall be alighted, because, by following this tutorial to the end, you can proudly and righteously call yourself a master of computer programming.

Learning coding can be done in just the four steps shown below. 

## Prep: Setting Up a Computer

To learn computer science you need a computer.
Any functional computer will be enough to get started.
For practical advices on buying a computer, see [appendix](../appendix/advice_on_buying_a_computer.md).

It is, nevertheless, always helpful to learn how each piece of the electronics and software work together to produce the powerful machine that we call a computer today.
See [what is a computer](../what_is_computer/summary.md).

You also need to choose an operating system. 
I recommend Linux.
Check [choosing OS](../what_is_computer/choosing_os.md)

## Step 1: Learn the Basics

One shall first learn to use the computer, acquire a programming language, and write some codes as an exercise.

Check how to using the computer on command line [here](../let_there_be_linux/linux_on_command_line.md).

Learn a programming language by instructions [here](../lets_write_code/chapter_summary.md).

[^disclaimer]: The author, at the time of writing, is a final year undergraduate student. 
In no ways the author may be regarded as an expert in these fields. 
He is actively learning and consulting other experts while composing this book.
*__Come__*, readers! We shall learn and advance together.
