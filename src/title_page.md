# Guide for Self Studying Coding

This is a guide for self studying computer science. 
The targeted audience are those with little or no experience of coding, and those who learn coding only for a specific task but lack the systematic knowledge. 
The only prerequisites are a personal computer and the determination to learn.

If you do not plan to study computer science, I encourage you to try.
Computer science and related technologies has influenced every aspect of our lives.
Not understanding how they work is the modern illiteracy.

As of July 2024, the book is still in early draft. 
The content is prereleased on
